# CineSight Frontend

CineSight is an interactive movie exploration platform that allows users to navigate through hundreds of movies and filter them based on specific criteria such as release year, average rating, and gross income. Users can view detailed information about each movie, along with a dynamically generated word cloud from user comments. This frontend application is built with React and NextJS.

## Project Background

This project originated as part of a university assignment aimed at creating a visualization based project on public or self-crated datastes. While the initial requirements have been fulfilled, the project is far from complete and will soon be extended with additional features and improvements. Please note that the current implementation is still a work in progress, and some aspects may not yet be fully functional or polished.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
