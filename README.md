# CineSight Frontend

CineSight is an interactive movie exploration platform that allows users to navigate through hundreds of movies and filter them based on specific criteria such as release year, average rating, and gross income. Users can view detailed information about each movie, along with a dynamically generated word cloud from user comments. This frontend application is built with React and is currently a work in progress.
