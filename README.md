# CineSight Frontend

CineSight is an interactive movie exploration platform that allows users to navigate through hundreds of movies and filter them based on specific criteria such as release year, average rating, and gross income. Users can view detailed information about each movie, along with a dynamically generated word cloud from user comments. This frontend application is built with React and is currently a work in progress.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
